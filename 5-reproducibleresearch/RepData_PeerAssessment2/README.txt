Synopsis
---------
The objective of this report is to draw conclusions about the impact of severe weather events in terms of both human health and economic damage. 
To complete this analysis, data is drawn from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(NOAA) Storm Database.

Specifically, this report will seek to investigate the following questions:

1. Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?

2. Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

This report will attempt to illuminate current trends by narrowing the scope of analysis to a timeframe of twenty years, spanning from 1991 - 2011 (the most recent year of published data in the dataset).
